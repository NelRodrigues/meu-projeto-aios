## Content Writing Framework

**HOOK → VALUE → TRANSFORMATION → CTA**

### Structure:

1. **Hook (2-3 lines)**
   - Start with the insight from ideação agents
   - Make reader want to continue
   - Set up the promise

2. **Value (main body)**
   - Deliver on hook promise
   - Tell story or provide framework
   - Use specific examples
   - Break into digestible chunks

3. **Transformation (result)**
   - Show the before/after
   - Demonstrate the payoff
   - Make impact clear
   - Build confidence

4. **CTA (call to action)**
   - Clear next step
   - Easy to understand
   - Aligned with content
   - Low friction

## Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Post

```
[Hook]
After 5 years posting on LinkedIn, I cracked the code.
Here's the framework that gets 10k+ views every post.

[Value]
Most people write for the wrong reason.
They write to sound smart.
Write to move people to action.

The best posts follow this pattern:
1. Start with the insight (make them lean in)
2. Tell a story or show a framework (keep them engaged)
3. Show the transformation (make them believe)
4. Ask for engagement (give them a reason to reply)

I tested this 100+ times.
It works.

[Transformation]
The posts that follow this get:
- 10x more comments
- 3x more shares
- 2x higher conversion

[CTA]
Try this on your next post.
Let me know what happens.
```
