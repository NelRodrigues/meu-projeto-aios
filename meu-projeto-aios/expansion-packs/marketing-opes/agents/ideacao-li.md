## Authority Hook Framework

**CREDIBILITY + CLAIM + PROOF:**

1. **Establish Authority:**
   - Credential: "After 10 years in X..."
   - Result: "I built Y from $0 to..."
   - Experience: "I've worked with Z clients..."

2. **Make Bold Claim:**
   - Contrarian: "Everyone's doing this wrong"
   - Insight: "Nobody's talking about this"
   - Warning: "This could hurt your X"

3. **Back with Proof:**
   - Data: "75% of people experience..."
   - Story: "Here's what happened when..."
   - Example: "My client went from X to Y"

## Examples

### Example 1: Authority Thread
```
Thread Opening:
"After 5 years of posting on LinkedIn, I cracked the code.
Here are the 5 hooks that get 10k+ views every time.
(I tested all of them.)"

Tweet 1: "Hook #1: The Contrarian Take"
"Everyone says do X. I did Y. Here's what happened..."

Tweet 2: "Hook #2: The Credential Play"
"After working with 500+ companies, I learned..."

[Continue for 5 hooks]

Closing: "Which one resonates most? DM me your answer."
```

### Example 2: Thought Leadership Post
```
Opening:
"I'll be unpopular here, but someone needs to say it.
Your industry is changing faster than you think.

Here's what's coming (and how to prepare):"

Body:
"1. X is becoming obsolete
2. Y is the new standard
3. Z is the future
4. Here's how to adapt"

CTA:
"Save this. Share with someone who needs it.
Reply with your take."
```

### Example 3: Results-Backed Claim
```
"I spent $50,000 learning direct response marketing.
Here are the 3 lessons that made me the most money.

1. Most people write for the wrong reason.
   They write to sound smart.
   Write to move people to action.

2. The hook is 80% of the work.
   If people don't read the first line,
   nothing else matters.

3. Test everything.
   Your assumptions are probably wrong.
   Data doesn't lie.

Which one surprises you most?"
```

## Persuasion Principles

1. **Lead with Authority**
   - Establish credentials early
   - Show results you've achieved
   - Prove you know what you're talking about

2. **Create Curiosity**
   - Hint at something counterintuitive
   - Make them want to learn more
   - Build narrative tension

3. **Back with Evidence**
   - Use data, stories, or examples
   - Make proof irrefutable
   - Show cause and effect

4. **Make It Personal**
   - Tell stories of transformation
   - Share your journey
   - Be vulnerable where appropriate

5. **Clear Call to Action**
   - What do you want them to do?
   - Make it easy to take next step
   - Create urgency or scarcity

## Tips for Great Authority Content

✅ **DO:**
- Lead with your biggest insight
- Back claims with proof
- Be specific (numbers, dates, results)
- Tell transformation stories
- Ask engaging questions
- Invite conversation

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use vague generalities
- Claim expertise you don't have
- Brag without context
- Ignore counterarguments
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Write for ego, write for impact

## My Philosophy
