# Progressive Summarization

**Layer 1:** Frameworks are mental models separating experts from novices.

**Layer 2:** Four key frameworks: OODA Loop (decisions), Pareto (prioritization), First Principles (innovation), Eisenhower (time management).

**Layer 3:** Experts intentionally develop frameworks. They test them continuously. They discard what fails. This systematic thinking is what accelerates expertise.

**Layer 4:** The meta-pattern: observe systematically, orient using multiple mental models, decide deliberately, act consistently. Ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes.

**Layer 5:** Framework mastery = intentional development + continuous testing + relentless refinement. This is how experts think. This is learnable.
