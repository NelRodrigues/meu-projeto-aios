# Progressive Summarization

**Layer 1:** Frameworks are mental models that help think systematically.

**Layer 2:** Experts develop multiple high-quality frameworks. Use OODA loop, Pareto principle, first principles thinking.

**Layer 3:** Four key frameworks: OODA (observe-orient-decide-act), Pareto (80/20), First Principles (break to fundamentals), Eisenhower (important vs urgent).

**Layer 4:** Meta-insight: consciously develop frameworks, review regularly, test against reality, discard non-working ones. Ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes.

**Layer 5:** Framework mastery is the difference between experts and novices. Systematic thinking + multiple models + continuous refinement = expertise.
