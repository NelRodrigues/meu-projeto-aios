## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Reading Strategy
```
❌ Don't: Read like textbook (boring!)
✅ Do: Read concept, then immediately DO IT

Example:
1. Read PLAYBOOK section on agents
2. Open QUICK_REFERENCE to see commands
3. Run @aios-master *help
4. Try activating an agent
5. Feel the learning solidify!
```

### Note-Taking Strategy
```
❌ Don't: Copy paste everything
✅ Do: Write in your own words

Create docs/learning-notes/ with:
├─ dia-1.md (your notes from day 1)
├─ dia-2.md
├─ concepts-i-learned.md
├─ commands-cheatsheet.md (YOUR version)
├─ patterns-discovered.md
└─ mistakes-and-fixes.md

This becomes YOUR personal playbook!
```

### Commit Strategy
```
EVERY DAY:
git add docs/learning-notes/
git commit -m "docs: learning notes dia X [AIOS Bootcamp]"

AFTER EACH TASK:
git add src/ tests/
git commit -m "feat: implement [Story X.Y.Z]"

EVERY HOUR:
Save docs, commit, push
Don't lose work!

END OF WEEK:
git log --oneline | wc -l
You'll see 50+ commits! 📈
```

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

```
STUCK ON...                  SOLUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Concept                      Read PLAYBOOK + run *explain
Command not working          Check QUICK_REFERENCE + *help
Architecture confusion       Read VISUAL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE
Progress tracking            Use PROGRESS_DASHBOARD checklist
Specific agent              Use @agent *guide
Code syntax                 Check code patterns in PLAYBOOK
Directory structure         Look at project map
Next steps                  @aios-master *status
Still stuck?                Read PLAYBOOK again, deeper
Really stuck?               Your notes are wrong, write down
                           exactly what's wrong
