# Database Specialist Review
**Workflow Phase:** 5
**Specialist:** @data-engineer
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Not Applicable)
**Date:** 2026-01-27

---

## Review Status

**Applicability:** ❌ NOT APPLICABLE

Since the project has no database (verified in Phase 2 pre-flight check), this specialist review is not required.

---

## Summary

**Finding:** No database configuration detected in meu-projeto-aios v1.0.0

**Validation:** ✅ Confirmed - No database-related technical debt to review

---

## When This Review Will Be Needed

This review should be scheduled when the project adds database functionality:
- PostgreSQL setup
- Supabase integration
- MongoDB implementation
- MySQL/MariaDB setup
- Or any other persistent data layer

---

## Recommendation

**Current Status:** Continue to Phases 6-7 (UX and QA reviews)

If database functionality is added in a future release, Phase 5 should be re-executed with full specialist analysis including:
- Schema design and optimization
- Security (RLS policies, encryption)
- Performance (indexing, query optimization)
- Data integrity and constraints
- Backup/recovery procedures
